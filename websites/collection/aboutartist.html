	<h1>about the artist</h1>
<p>Eric Fischl is a Neo-Expressionist painter, known for his depictions of middle-class, suburban America. The themes he explores consist of disturbing behavior acted out by seemingly normal subjects. He calls attention to the hypocrisy of white, suburbia by depicting those who would normally gasp at this behavior as the ones actually indulging in it. This ultimately reveals that everyone can have a dark and disturbing life behind closed doors, no matter how put together one might seem.</p>
