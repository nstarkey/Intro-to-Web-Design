		The next morning, he went with it to the man and said to him, "No one shall be my wife except for the one whose foot fits this golden shoe." The two sisters were happy to hear this, for they had pretty feet. With her mother standing by, the older one took the shoe into her bedroom to try it on. She could not get it on. She could not get her big toe into it, for the shoe was too small for her. Then her mother gave her a <a href="blood.html">knife</a> and said, "Cut off your big toe. When you are queen you will no longer have to go on foot." The girl cut off her toe. He took her on his horse as his bride and rode away with her.
