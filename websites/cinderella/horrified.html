		The stepmother and the two stepsisters were horrified and turned pale with anger.
	</p>
	<p>
		When the wedding with the prince was to be held, the two false sisters came, wanting to gain favor with Cinderella and to share her good fortune. When the bridal couple walked into the church, the older sister walked on their right side and the younger sister walked on their left side, and the pigeons pecked out one eye from each of them. Afterwards, as they came out of the church, the older one was on the left side and the younger one on the right side and the pigeons pecked out the other eye from each of them. And thus, for their wickedness and falsehood, they were punished with blindness for as long as they lived.
