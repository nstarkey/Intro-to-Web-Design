		Now that no one else was at home, Cinderella went to her mother's grave beneath the hazel tree, and cried out: "Shake and quiver little tree, throw gold and silver down to me." Then the bird threw a <a href="beautiful.html">gold</a> and silver dress down to her, and slippers embroidered with silk and silver. She quickly put on the dress and went to the festival.
