	The Lord Chamberlain bowed low to her, thinking she must be a very great lady by her dress and carriage, and he showed her at once into the <a href="princess.html">ball-room</a>. She was so beautiful that everybody looked at her, and wondered who she was; and the prince asked her to dance with him, and afterwards would dance with no one else. But she made haste to leave a little before the hour fixed, and had time to undress before her sisters came home.
	
	The prince was quite vexed when supper-time came and he could not find his beautiful partner.</p>
