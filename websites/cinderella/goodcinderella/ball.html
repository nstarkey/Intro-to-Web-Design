	It happened, when Cinderella was about seventeen years old, that the King of that country gave a <a href="godmother.html">ball</a>, to which all ladies of the land, and among the rest the young girl's sisters, were invited. 
</p>
<p>
	"I wish you would take me to the ball with you," said Cinderella, meekly. "Take you, indeed!" answered the elder sister, with a sneer; "It is no place for a cinder-sifter: say at home and do your work."
