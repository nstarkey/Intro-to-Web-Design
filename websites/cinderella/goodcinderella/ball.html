	It happened, when Cinderella was about seventeen years old, that the King of that country gave a <a href="godmother.html">ball</a>, to which all ladies of the land, and among the rest the young girl's sisters, were invited. 

	"I wish you would take me to the ball with you," said Cinderella, meekly. "Take you, indeed!" answered the elder sister, with a sneer; "It is no place for a cinder-sifter: say at home and do your work."
