		When they were gone, Cinderella, whose heart was very sad, sat down and cried bitterly; but as she sat sorrowful, thinking of the unkindness of her sisters, a voice called to her from the garden. It was her godmother, a good old fairy. "Do not cry Cinderella," she said. "you shall also go to the ball, because you are a kind, good girl. Bring me a large pumpkin." Cinderella obeyed and the fairy, touching it with her wand, turned it into a grand coach. 
		
		 Next, the fairy touched Cinderella's rags, and they became rich satin robes, trimmed with point lace. Cinderella kissed and thanked her <a href="ballroom.html">godmother</a>. Then she stepped into her coach and drove off. </p>
