		The next day, when the festival began anew, the prince danced only with her. When evening came Cinderella wanted to leave and the prince tried to escort her, but she ran away from him so quickly that he could not follow her. The prince, however, had set a trap. He had had the enitre stairway smeared with pitch. When she ran down the stairs, her left <a href="knife.html">slipper</a> stuck in the pitch. The prince picked it up. It was small and dainty, and of pure gold.
